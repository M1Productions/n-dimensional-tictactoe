# n-dimensional-tictactoe
A game with n dimensions, all layed down onto a flat surface for you to play it on your smartphone

Welcome to n-Dimensional-TicTacToe!

Essentially, it is exactly that, a game of TicTacToe but in more than just two small, boring dimensions.
You can play it alone against BOTs or together with friends (if existent) on one device.

For us, it is more a test to see how the whole thing with google play and everything related to that, actually works.
We will eventually bring out an update here and there, but we will focus on other apps asap.

Hope you (will) have some fun with our little game, with friends, to kill time, in boring English lessons...
Ah and btw. we are not native English so please understand if something sounds a little off, we try our best.
